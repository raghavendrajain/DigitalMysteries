In this directory, I preserve the notion of handling of each individual dartaslip.
There are totatal of 9 dataslips being handled by each team. 
Each row in the nameOfFile.stringDB corresponds to the sequential actions made on each of the dataslips.
Since, there are a total of 5 teams, a total of 5 x 9 = 45 action sequences are observed.
